# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

 This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

 
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


Calendar starts at 9am and goes to 5 pm 
turns to grey when time is out. 
red for the hour is current
green for what is coming next. 
hours are located on the left side.  a save button on the right side.  The events can be changed, then saved.


The title needs a date: thursay, september 15th  - nothing else changes  - Use Moment for calendar
